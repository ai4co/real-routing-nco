### üó∫Ô∏è Problem
Most NCO methods use simplified routing with 2D Euclidean distance. This is not realistic for real-world applications which can have complex 1) _distance matrices_ and 2) _duration matrices_ between locations because of road networks, traffic, and more.

  <em>Left: previous works with simplified routing. Right: RRNCO with real-world routing!</em>
  <br>
</p>

How can we bridge this gap between toy and real settings?

We need two things:
1) A **dataset** with real-world routing information
2) A **model** that can handle such data -- not only node but also _edge_ information




### ‚ú® Solution 1: RRNCO Dataset

We introduce the RRNCO (Real Routing NCO) dataset, which contains real-world routing information for 100 cities around the world, from which instances can be subsampled and generated on the fly

### ‚ú® Solution 2: The RRNCO Model

The RRNCO model efficiently processes topology information by leveraging several techniques including scale adaptive biases

## üöÄ Installation

We use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (extremely fast Python package manager) to manage the dependencies:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12 # create a new virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment
uv sync --all-extras # for all dependencies
```

Note that this project is also compatible with normal `pip install -e .` in case you use a different package manager.

### Data download

Download data and checkpoints
To download the data and checkpoints from HuggingFace automatically, you can use:

```bash
python scripts/download_hf.py
```

You may use the option "--no-data" to skip the dataset or "--no-models" to skip the checkpoints.


## Data generation

> [!TIP]
> This is already done when you download the dataset from HuggingFace. You can skip this step if you only want to use the pretrained models.

### Dataset generation
Instructions on how to install the OSRM backend and generate (new) datasets [data_generation](data_generation/README.md) folder.

After generating city data using the data generation pipeline, move the generated files to the following directory:

`data/dataset/{city}/{city}_data.npz`

For example, if the city is Seoul, the data file should be located at:

`data/dataset/Seoul/Seoul_data.npz`

Additionally, the file `data/dataset/splited_cities_list.json` contains a predefined split of cities into training and test sets. If you wish to modify the training cities, simply edit the list under the `"train"` key in this JSON file.


### Test instances generation

To (re)generate the test dataset (included in HuggingFace already):


```bash
python scripts/generate_data.py
```

This will generate test instance from the dataset provided above.


## How to run

To get started with running RRNCO, please follow the steps below:


### Training

To train a model, use the `train.py` script. For example, to train a model for the ATSP problem:

```bash
python train.py experiment=rrnet env=atsp
```
Available environment options are:

- atsp (Asymmetric TSP)

- rcvrp (Real-world Capacitated VRP(ACVRP))

- rcvrptw (Real-world Capacitated VRP with Time Windows(ACVRPTW))

You can also configure experiment settings using the file `config/experiment/rrnet.yaml`.

### Model Testing

You can evaluate a trained model using the `test.py` script. Make sure to provide the correct dataset path via `--datasets` and model checkpoint via `--checkpoint`.

Examples for different tasks:

**ATSP**
```bash
python test.py --problem atsp --datasets data/atsp/atsp_n100_seed3333_in_distribution.npz --batch_size 32 --checkpoint checkpoints/atsp/epoch_199.ckpt
```

**RCVRP**
```bash
python test.py --problem rcvrp --datasets data/rcvrp/rcvrp_n100_seed3333_in_distribution.npz --batch_size 32 --checkpoint checkpoints/rcvrp/epoch_199.ckpt
```

**RCVRPTW**
```bash
python test.py --problem rcvrptw --datasets data/rcvrptw/rcvrptw_n100_seed3333_in_distribution.npz --batch_size 32 --checkpoint checkpoints/rcvrptw/epoch_199.ckpt
```
